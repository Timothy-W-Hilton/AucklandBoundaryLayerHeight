# Auckland, New Zealand Boundary Layer height

This script plots Auckland ceilometer data (planetary boundary layer height above ground level) vs. hour of day, grouped by season, with envelopes showing the spread in the data. Uses [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) for plotting/grouping.

## Data Source

The Auckland ceilometer data were published by (Wagner and Shafer, 2017)[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.uclim.2015.11.001], and are available [online](https://catalogue.data.govt.nz/dataset/oai-figshare-com-article-11750721). [Marley et al (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10546-020-00579-w) discuss controls on the boundary layer height.
